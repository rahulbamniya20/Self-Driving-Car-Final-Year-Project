# Self-Driving-Car-Final-Year-Project
We have designed a deep reinforcement learning agent capable of playing a car racing game. While existing solutions have been successful in specific routes only.

# Introduction
A car-driving agent can analyze the environment without human interaction and make decisions accordingly. A number of sensors are connected and used to detect road and path signals from the environment. Deep reinforcement resulted in new capabilities for complex navigation and control tasks.

Self-driving agents make decisions and communicate with each other. Autonomous cars combine different technologies to sense their environment using sensors. Sophisticated control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigational paths and signs. Potential The benefits of autonomous cars include increased safety, increased mobility, increased customer satisfaction, and fewer accidents.
