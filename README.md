# Self-Driving-Car-Final-Year-Project
We have designed a deep reinforcement learning agent capable of playing a car racing game. While existing solutions have been successful in specific routes only.

# Introduction
Imagine an AI race car driver that masters any track! This project uses deep learning to train an agent to conquer different racing courses. It's like teaching a super-student to ace exams, but instead of equations, it's learning how to handle curves, avoid crashes, and win races on the fly. This paves the way for future AI that can navigate complex situations, not just in games, but in self-driving cars, robots, and beyond!

# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to create an artificial agent that can successfully play a racing game on different tracks using deep reinforcement learning. The main challenge of this task is that the agent must navigate through terrain with varying conditions which can make it difficult to maintain control and achieve high performance. Moreover, the agent must learn quickly and effectively in this complex environment.
